    <h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>This course will introduce students to the skills required in owning and running a business.

        Students will learn the concepts involved in owning a business including starting a business, business plans, legal forms, selling, advertising, and tax issues. Business confidence will be developed through hands-on experience including simulations, 
        case studies, and practical experience.</p>

    <h2>Teaming for Innovation</h2>
    <p> Innovation is the creation of better or more effective products, processes, services, 
      technologies, or ideas that are readily available to markets, governments, and society. 
      9Innovation differs from invention in that innovation refers to the use of a better and, as a result, 
      novel idea or method, whereas invention refers more directly to the creation of the idea or method itself. 
      Innovation differs from improvement in that innovation refers to the notion of doing something 
      different rather than doing the same thing better.</p>

    <h2>Project management</h2>
    <p>Project management is the discipline of planning, organizing, securing, managing, leading, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A project is a temporary endeavor with a defined beginning and end 
      9(usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables),
      [1] undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives,
      [2] typically to bring about beneficial change or added value. 
      The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with business as usual.</p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>We also provide proper training for the coding that is required in the projects.
      The code is then tested before hosting the project live on the server.
      And when the proper testing of the code with all the required changes is done then it is finally deployed.</p>
